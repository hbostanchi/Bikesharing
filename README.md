## About Citibike

Citi Bike is the nation's largest bike share program, with 13,000 bikes and over 850 stations across Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens and Jersey City. It was designed for quick trips with convenience in mind, and it’s a fun and affordable way to get around town.
Citi Bike, like other bike share systems, consists of a fleet of specially designed for subscribers and not only one time users. 

The majority of customers are subscribers to the service rather than a one time customer. This data from August, which can be considered peak tourism season in New York, tells us that although a portion of the profits come from non subscribers, most can be contributed to regular users who are not tourists. We can assume these are local users who repeatedly use these bikes. An explanation for this use could be subscribers who use citibike to perform their daily commute.his suggests that people don’t take city bike for very distant traveling making citibike an ideal option for people who commute modest distances to get to work in the city.

Citi Bike is available for use 24 hours/day, 7 days/week, 365 days/year, and riders have access to thousands of bikes at hundreds of stations across Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens and Jersey City.
